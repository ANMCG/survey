				<h1>What were we testing?</h1>
				<p>We were researching different ways in which computers can automatically compose music.
				<p>We tested three different methods:
				<ul><li>Random: a completely random note was chosen each time
				<li>First order: this looked at music composed by humans and used the probability of each note following the previous note to get something more predictable.
				<li>Second order: this was similar to first order, except it also took the note before the previous note into account.
				</ul>
				<p>We generated 10 different melodies using each method, so 30 melodies in total. Then, we gave our participants two random melodies from two of the methods and asked them to choose between the two, and then give them two new melodies and so on until the participant had come across each melody once.
				<h1>What did we find?</h1>
				<p>Our participants strongly preferred the first order melodies over the melodies generated by the other two methods. There was no preference between random and second order.
				<h1>Which melody did people like the most?</h1>
				<p>The melody preferred by the most people was the following first order melody:</p>
				<button class="play" onclick="listenBest()"></button>
				<h1>Which melody did people like the least?</h1>
				<p>The melody disliked by the most people was the following random melody:</p>
				<button class="play" onclick="listenWorst()"></button>
